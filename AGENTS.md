# Agent Instructions

## Git Commits
- **Do not create git commits.** The user will handle git commits themselves.
- All code changes should be written and tested, but final commit decisions remain with the user.

## Documentation
- **Do not write documentation** unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Focus on implementation only.

## Dev Server
- **Do not start the dev server** on your own.
- The user has a dev server running all the time for testing.
- Let the user handle server restarts and reloading.
